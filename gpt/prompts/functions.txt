Function: Localize(scene_representation, obj_name)
Explanation: The function accepts two inputs: a 3D scene representation, referred to as scene_representation, and an object name, called obj_name. It then returns the 3D coordinates of the target object within the 3D scene. Currently, the default setting for scene_representation is 'nerf'.

Function: Retrieval(obj_name)
Explanation: The function returns a 3D object by retrieving it from a 3D model database using an object name, referred to as obj_name.

Function: Segmentation(scene_representation, semantic_class)
Explanation: The function accepts two inputs: a 3D scene representation, referred to as scene_representation, and a semantic class, called semantic_class. It then returns segments of a certain area within the 3D scene based on the provided semantic class. Currently, the default setting for scene_representation is 'nerf'.

Function: Texturing(obj, texture_name)
Explanation: The function accepts two inputs: a 3D object representation, referred to as obj, and a texture identifier, called texture_name. It modifies the object's texture based on the provided texture identifier and returns the resultant textured object.

Function: Insertion(scene_representation, obj, loc)
Explanation: The function accepts three inputs:  a 3D scene representation, referred to as scene_representation, a 3D object representation, referred to as obj, and 3D locations in the scene named loc. It places the 3D object at the specified locations within the 3D scene. Currently, the default setting for scene_representation is 'nerf'.

Function: Remove(scene_representation, seg)
Explanation: The function accepts two inputs: a 3D scene representation, referred to as scene_representation, and 3D segments named seg. It removes objects situated within the specified segmented area within the 3D scene. Currently, the default setting for scene_representation is 'nerf'.

Function: Export_3D(scene_representation, seg)
Explanation: The function accepts two inputs: a 3D scene representation, referred to as scene_representation, and 3D segments named seg. It exports 3D objects from the given segmented area within the 3D scene. Currently, the default setting for scene_representation is 'nerf'.

Function: Relight(scene_representation, light_condition)
Explanation: The function accepts two inputs: a 3D scene representation, referred to as scene_representation, and a light condition, called light_condition. It manipulates the lighting within the 3D scene to match the input light conditions. Currently, the default setting for scene_representation is 'nerf'.

Function: Simulation(scene_representation, seg, weather_condition)
Explanation: The function accepts three inputs: a 3D scene representation, referred to as scene_representation, 3D segments named seg, and a weather condition called weather_condition. It simulates a particular weather condition within the segmented areas in the 3D scene. Currently, the default setting for scene_representation is 'nerf'. Note that if seg is None, the weather condition will be simulated across the entire 3D scene.

Function: Break(scene_representation, obj, break_condition)
Explanation: The function accepts three inputs:  a 3D scene representation, referred to as scene_representation, a 3D object representation, referred to as obj, and a breaking option called break_condition. It splits the specified object into multiple smaller pieces within the 3D scene according to the break_condition. Currently, the default setting for scene_representation is 'nerf'.
