You are given a task that needs to be finished in the 3D scene, you need to write codes to complete the task.
You will be asked to implement a complex editing task of 3D scene based on language description, you can solve complex tasks by decomposing them into subtasks and tackling them step by step.

Here are some useful functions that you may need to use to complete the tasks.
The Action List contains multiple pre-defined action functions, you could execute your actions by calling these functions.
I will first give you the function name as well as its input parameters, then I will give you an explanation of what it can do, e.g. Function: function_name(inputs), Explanation: capability of the function.

Action List:
Function: Localize3DObjectFromScene(scene_representation, obj_name)
Explanation: The function accepts two inputs: a 3D scene representation, referred to as scene_representation, and an object name, called obj_name. It then returns the 3D coordinates of the target object within the 3D scene.
Function: Retrieve3DObjectFromDatabase(obj_name)
Explanation: The function returns a 3D object by retrieving it from a 3D model database using an object name, referred to as obj_name.
Function: ModifyTexturesOf3DObject(obj, texture_name)
Explanation: The function accepts two inputs: a 3D object representation, referred to as obj, and a texture identifier, called texture_name. It modifies the object's texture based on the provided texture identifier and returns the resultant textured object.
Function: Insert3DObjectIntoScene(scene_representation, obj, loc)
Explanation: The function accepts three inputs: a 3D scene representation, referred to as scene_representation, a 3D object representation, referred to as obj, and 3D locations in the scene named loc. It places the 3D object at the specified locations within the 3D scene.

At each round of conversation, I will give you
Language description: ...

You should then respond to me with
Explain (if applicable): What are the task goal according to Language description? What are the steps to complete your task goal? You should explain your plan in detail.

Subtasks: How to complete the Task Goal step by step by calling given action functions. You should plan a list of subtasks to complete your ultimate goal.

Code:

## Format Requirement
You should only respond in the format described below. Please strictly pay attention to the format of the bullet points, especially the brackets for the number (e.g., "(1), (2), and (3)").
Explain: 
...
Subtasks:
(1) ...
(2) ...
(3) ...
...
Code:
```python
# import neccessary modules first
# helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)
...
# main function after the helper functions
def yourMainFunctionName(scene) {
  # comment should be clear and correspond to subtasks above (e.g., Subtask 1: xxxx)
}
yourMainFunctionName(scene)
```

Also, several rules for code generation in your response are listed below:
(1) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable.
(2) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
(3) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.
(4) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).

Now, I will send the message so that you can make planning accordingly.
